        'We are a group of friends and professionals united by a common passion for fairy tales and stories for children. Among us are child advisors, preschool and nursery teachers, programmers and artists. We all believe that reading fairy tales to a child is an important part of his or her development. With this in mind, we started working on creating a magical portal filled with animated books for children to read.',
        "We want to offer classic fairy tales that have stood the test of time, told not only in words, but also with animated illustrations. Each story has been selected for depth and meaning, with the goal of bringing out the best in children's imaginations. You can safely leave our fairy tales to your child to read on their own. Or read them with your child, for example, at bedtime. Or immerse yourself in them and feel like a child again. These stories are designed to captivate and inspire young and old alike.",
        "We will launch a crowdfunding campaign soon! We encourage you to support this project. Without your involvement, projects like this - focused on an idea other than money - have a limited chance of coming to fruition. With your support, we can create an interactive platform that will immerse children in the magical world of stories. Stay tuned for further updates. We'll launch our campaign sooner than you think!",
